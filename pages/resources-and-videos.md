**Syllabi, are not getting migrated; this is too much intranet material for us to house. The program can migrate these into Google docs and create links for me to post into a pdf to link up if they want to keep these.** 

**The Past Newsletters Mailchimp urls need to be shared with me so I can link to the previous web version of the newsletter. We are not migrating newsletters that have been downloaded as postcards and saved as pdf's.
