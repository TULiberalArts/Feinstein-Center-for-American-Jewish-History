## 2019 Summer Fellowship Award Recipients
The Feinstein Center for American Jewish History announces the selection of its Summer Fellows for 2019:

![Jeremiah Lockwood]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resizedjeremiah.png){:.responsive-img .img-right}
**_Jeremiah Lockwood_** (PhD candidate, Stanford University)<br>
Jeremiah Lockwood has played music around the world from Montreal Jazz Festival to the Festival au Desert in Timbuktu, Mali, as the leader of The Sway Machinery and as the guitarist in Balkan Beat Box. He was a recipient of the Six Points Fellowship for Emerging Jewish Artists, an Artist-in-Residence for the Forward and a Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra Composer Fellow. He is currently completing a PhD at Stanford University. His thesis focuses on cantorial music revivalism in the Chassidic community in Brooklyn, NY. His duo project Book of J (with singer Jewlia Eisenberg) released their debut album in 2018. Jeremiah is again collaborating with Jewlia on his current project, _LA Archivera_. _LA Archivera_ is an exploration of the recordings of archivist Emily Sene. From the 1940s to the 1970s, Emily Sene gathered music without institutional support or academic background. Her collection documents and illuminates the experience of Sephardic Jewish immigrants to California through music.

**_April Rosenblum_** (PhD candidate, York University)<br>
April Rosenblum is an MA candidate in History at York University. Her thesis follows microhistorical threads from a single crime in Philadelphia to the dissolution of grassroots urban interaction between white Jewish and Black communities in midcentury America. In 1971, an elderly Jewish shopkeeper’s murder by a younger Black man seemed to neatly fit Philadelphia’s headlines of rising crime and racial tensions. But beneath the surface lay a different story: of intimacy and interdependence between white Jewish and Black leftists in an age of political crisis. This research shifts focus from narratives of mutual betrayal to examine the postwar roots of Black-Jewish separation, the political tolls of the Cold War, and the unconventional bonds that endured.

**_Alissa Schapiro_** (PhD candidate, Northwestern University)<br>
Alissa Schapiro is a PhD Candidate in Art History at Northwestern University. Her dissertation investigates the relationship between American cultural production and the Holocaust during World War II. She traces artistic, institutional, performative, and mass media-related practices in order to understand the ways in which the American cultural field mediated knowledge of the ongoing mass genocide of European Jews by the Nazis, while also questioning the impact of American antisemitism on these various projects.
