## 2020 Summer Fellowship Award Recipients
The Feinstein Center for American Jewish History announces the selection of its Summer Fellows for 2020:

![Ariel Cohen]({{site.baseurl}}/media/arielcohen.jpeg){:.responsive-img .img-right}
**_Ariel Cohen_** (PhD candidate, University of Virginia)<br>
Ariel Cohen is a PhD candidate at the University of Virginia in the Department of History. Her dissertation, _Displaying Art and Exhibiting Philanthropy: Jews, Gender, and Museums in the United States, 1915 – 1958_, offers a gendered history of Jewish cultural philanthropy in United States museums. Beginning 1915 with Rebbetzin Mignon Rubenovitz's move to Boston (where she'd later found a Jewish Museum) ending in 1958 with New York Jewish Museum benefactor Frieda Warburg’s death, Ariel’s project examines the individuals and networks that donated their time, talent, and treasure to Jewish exhibitions in American museums and thereby altered the course of American Jewish life. By creating Jewish art museum spaces, which served as vehicles for Jews to formulate and express their own identities, women exercised their own privilege through philanthropy while remaining marginal as Jewish outsiders to mainstream American (Christian) life and women outsiders to mainstream Jewish (male) leadership.

![Andrew Fogel]({{site.baseurl}}/media/andrewfogel.jpg){:.responsive-img .img-right}
**_Andrew Fogel_** (MA candidate, Purdue University)<br>
Andrew Fogel is a PhD candidate at Purdue University in the Department of History specializing in modern US cultural history. His dissertation examines the racial architecture, sociocultural impact, and reception of the superhero fantasy as well as its Jewish creators’ relationship to the nation from inception in the late 1930s to the crisis of September 11, 2001. This historical project argues that the racial design of the superhero fantasy must be understood through its Jewish architects and their struggle to enter as well as shape the establishment culture of white Protestant America.

![Maxwell Greenberg]({{site.baseurl}}/media/maxwellgreenberg.JPG){:.responsive-img .img-right}
**_Maxwell Greenberg_** (PhD candidate, UCLA)<br>
Maxwell Greenberg is a PhD candidate at UCLA’s César E Chávez Department of Chicana/o Studies. He is interested in Jewish histories of the Americas, transnational and cross-border entrepreneurial networks, and regional and relational contexts of race formation. Maxwell’s dissertation research employs traditional archival methods to explore histories of Jewish placemaking, entrepreneurship and race in the US-Mexico border region between the mid 19th – mid 20th centuries. He was the 2019-2020 Scholar-In-Residence at the Jewish History Museum in Tucson, Arizona and the 2018-2019 Jack H Skirball Fellow in Modern Jewish Culture. Maxwell’s work has been featured in Jewish Currents and Protocols on the topics of Jewishness in the Americas, race, gender and borders.

![Hannah Greene]({{site.baseurl}}/media/hannahgreene.jpeg){:.responsive-img .img-right}
**_Hannah Greene_** (PhD candidate, New York University)<br>
Hannah Greene is a doctoral candidate in American Jewish history at New York University’s Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies. Her dissertation, _Able to Be American: American Jews and the Public Charge Provision in United States Immigration Policy, 1891-1934_, explores how American Jews engaged with discrimination on the basis of health, disability, and poverty in federal immigration law and its enforcement. Through centering immigrant advocates like Cecilia Razovsky and Max Kohler, who emphasized and contested constructions of “defect” in policy and its administration, her research investigates American Jewish leaders’ conceptions of American citizenship at the intersection of gender and disability. Hannah's dissertation analyzes how American Jewish communal leaders responded to public charge’s selection and classification of immigrants into the “desirable” and “undesirable,” and in the process shaped their own political roles and voices.
